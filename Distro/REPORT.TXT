Please note below what parts of your task were completed, and for
incomplete tasks, give a brief description of progress and how
you think the task could be completed

a) Implemented randomized particle initialization

	completed, set n particles randomliy away from the wall and give each partilces equalized probability.

b) Implemented particle likelihood computation using Gaussian 
   noise model.

	completed, use Gaussian noise model to compute every sonar slices of a particle to get the probabilities.

c) Implemented Step 1 in the starter code

	completed, move particles in the same direction from the robot, if the particles hit the wall, then turn 180 degree.

d) Implemented Step 3 in the starter code

	completed, compute particles' probabilities according to Gussian noise model.

e) Implemented Step 4 in the starter code
  
	completed, randomly filter high probabilities and ignore the low probabilities particles.

Questions:

1) For each of the maps provided, give your estimate of the minimum
   number of particles required for reliably successful localization
   (i.e. the robot succeeds almost always).
	map_A: at least 300 particles.
	map_B: at least 1000 particles.
	map_C: at least 800 particles.
	map_D: at least 600 particles.
	maze: at least 2000 particles.

2) What properties of the map make the localization task difficult?

	similar position.

3) What is the effect of a non-Gaussian noise model in the performance
   of the particle filter?
	
	if we do not use Gaussian noise model, then it will affect the estimate of probability of particles.

4) What would you do to improve the sensor model?

	change the sigma of the Gaussian noise model to match the sensor model. 


5) The motion model is noisy. Each time the robot moves, the direction
   of motion is slightly altered in a random manner. This is why the
   robot wanders around instead of moving in a straight line.

   a) Is this something we can avoid in the real world?

  
   b) Is it a bug or a feature?

   
   c) Would the particle filter work with noiseless motion?
      if yes, under what conditions...
      if no, why?
